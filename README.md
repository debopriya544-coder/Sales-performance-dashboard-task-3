# Sales-performance-dashboard-task-3
I downloded the data from chatgpt.
By using this data I made 3 dashboard. Sales Profit and Growth
In the sales dashboard I made cards of total and avg sales and charts of category wise, region wise and date wise sales.And I made a nevigation key for going to the profit dashboard.
Similarly, in the profit dashboard I made cards of total and avg profit and charts for profit.There also has a nevigation key for going to the growth dashboard.
In the dashboard I made two KPIs of sales and profit to show the growth of current year compare to previous years.
There I also creat a nevigation key to back the main dashboard.
I made a ppt also using the dashboard.
